# Ruohao's portfolio

In this repository, I have build my own portfolio as a full stack project.

I'll be using some of the most popular tech to take a step into the full stack development :

1. Programming languages
   - Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS
2. Libraries & Frameworks
   - React, Next.js, Tailwind
3. Tools
   - Git, Github, Docker, Node.js
